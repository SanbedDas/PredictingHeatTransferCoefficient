## Predicting Heat Transfer Coefficient using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Heat Transfer Coefficient Prediction** project, where we embark on a journey to enhance heat transfer processes in the realm of chemical engineering. 

### Understanding Heat Transfer Coefficient
In the domain of heat transfer, the heat transfer coefficient stands as a pivotal parameter dictating the rate at which heat transfers between two mediums. My mission involves delving deep into the dynamics of this coefficient and harnessing its potential for process optimization, issue identification, and heat exchanger design.

### Data-Driven Exploration
This project involves meticulous data collection encompassing various parameters that influence the heat transfer coefficient. Parameters such as temperature difference, fluid flow rate, fluid properties, and more, provide the foundation for our machine-learning model.

### Leveraging Machine Learning
Utilizing this data, I trained a machine learning model with a singular purpose: predicting the heat transfer coefficient based on the input parameters. This predictive prowess holds immense promise in optimizing heat transfer processes, identifying potential setbacks, and designing superior heat exchangers.

### Impact and Innovation
The ripple effects of this endeavour are substantial. The ability to optimize heat transfer processes not only enhances efficiency and effectiveness in chemical engineering but also alleviates costs and elevates product quality.

### Key Input Parameters
- Temperature difference between the two mediums
- Fluid flow rate
- Thermal conductivity of the fluids
- Viscosity of the fluids
- Density of the fluids
- Surface area of the heat exchanger
- Heat transfer coefficient of the fluids in the absence of fouling
- Fouling resistance of the heat exchanger
- Geometry and dimensions of the heat exchanger
- Reynolds number of the fluid flow

## Model Comparison and Results

In this project, I developed and evaluated various machine learning models for predicting the heat transfer coefficient. Below are the results using Mean Square Error (MSE) and R2 score:

| Model                         | Mean Square Error (MSE) | R2 score |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Multilinear Regression Model  | 138392.352              | 0.317    |
| SVR Model                     | 45982.085               | 0.8646   |
| Decision Tree Model           | 8641.302                | 0.9745   |
| Random Forest Model           | 7401.922                | 0.9634   |

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Among the models developed, the **Decision Tree Model** and **Random Forest Model** demonstrated superior performance in predicting the heat transfer coefficient. Both models yielded lower MSE values and higher R2 scores compared to other models. Notably, the Decision Tree Model exhibited the highest accuracy, with the lowest MSE and the highest R2 score.

For future work, addressing limitations such as data quality, inclusion of additional relevant variables, exploring non-linear models, and improving computational efficiency would enhance the project's accuracy and applicability.
